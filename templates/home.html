    <h5>
      JobCentric is built on one foundational principal - no person filling out a job application or an employeer
      deserves to feel unsure in where they stand. With a system built in place to both manage and track the status of job listings,
      applications, and other key parts that play a role in hiring/applying, JobCentric can make applying to jobs a
      little less stressful.
